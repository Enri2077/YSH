s.periodOfUpload * 1/s.meanTimeToWatch
(first the uploads I watch first && first the uncommon uploads)
i.e.:
	(Tu, watch immidiatly) > (Tu, watch later)
	(once a month, watch immidiatly) > (once a week, watch immidiatly) > (once a day, watch immidiatly)
	

-s.meanTimeToWatch

Relative ordering between subscriptions:
Being s(u) the subscription that has published the upload u.
Partitioning the time in intervals i, such that no new uploads have been published in i;
Letting be the uploads u_i, those that were available in the interval i.
Letting be the uploads v_i, those that were viewed (clicked on) in the interval i.
There is a partially ordered relationship σ between the subscriptions s' in s(v_i), given by the order in which the first of s' uploads are viewed in the interval i.
i.e.: s1,s2,s3,s1 → s1>s2>s3
